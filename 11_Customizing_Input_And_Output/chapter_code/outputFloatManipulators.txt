Floating-point formats

fixed       use fixed-point notation

scientific  use mantissa and exponent notation 
                the mantissa is always in the [1:10) range;
                    that is, there is a single nonzero digit before the decimal point

defaultfloat    choose fixed or scientific to give the numerically most accurate representation, within the precision of defaultfloat
